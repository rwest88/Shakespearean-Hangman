// Who would Fardels bear,
// To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
// But that the dread of something after death,
// The undiscovered Country, from whose bourn
// No Traveller returns, Puzzles the will,
// And makes us rather bear those ills we have,
// Than fly to others that we know not of.
// Thus Conscience does make Cowards of us all,
// And thus the Native hue of Resolution
// Is sicklied o'er, with the pale cast of Thought,
// And enterprises of great pith and moment,
// With this regard their Currents turn awry,
// And lose the name of Action. Soft you now,
// The fair Ophelia? Nymph, in thy Orisons
// Be all my sins remembered.]

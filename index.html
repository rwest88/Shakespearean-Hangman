    // master plan::::::::

    // game concept: Player plays rounds trying to fill in big chunks of Shakespeare's soliloquies.
        // (and other meaningful narratives or sonnets) Such large strings cause the gameplay,  
        // when following the rules of traditional hangman, FAR TOO EASY. So, the gameplay gets a 
        // makeover.

    // play concept:  You don't get penalized for guessing a wrong letter--you LOSE IMMEDIATELY!
        //each round, you must solve the puzzle with as few letters guessed as possible.
        //the more letters you guess, the lower your health drops. To solve, you must type out all 
        //of the characters.  Health then restores by time bonus * length of puzzle. The game ends when your
        //health empties or when you incorrectly solve a puzzle. [or, mistakes in puzzle-solving diminish health.]

    // the gameplay:

        // choose difficulty.

//maybe>>   //very easy - very famous lines, no deaths for incorrect letter entries
//startHere>//easy - famous hamlet, macbeth, romeo and juliet soliloquies, famous sonnets maybe 
            //medium - othello, king lear, midsummer whatever, yadda yadda
            //hard - whatever the hell else that guy wrote
//maybe>>   //expert - no punctuation provided, you must enter it. puzzle-solving is also case-sensitive.

              //other things to factor into difficulty: time-limit, penalty for letter-guesses
        
        //The computer/server generates a random selection of poetry, then filters it to show you blanks,
            // spaces, and punctuation.

        //Guess letters and watch them appear. NO mistakes allowed (don't start with 'x' or 'z'!). All letter
           // selections (all guesses) are penalized, and lower your health.  Tragic.

        //Watch your number of guesses, and your time.  Time bonuses will offset your 
          // guess penalties after you've solved.  Guess penalties are exponential (per round)--first 5-10
          // don't count for much, 15-20 == lethal.

        //You must decide to solve.  There will be a button or keyboard shortcut.  You will have to type out 
          // all characters (including ones already filled.) The current character on the text field
          // will be highlighted. Calling this the cursor, this may or may not "sit" on a character and allow multiple
          // attempts (perhaps depending on difficulty).  The computer checks your answer.  

        //win, and your time bonuses and guess penalties are displayed, and score is adjusted and displayed.
          // on to the next round; same difficulty level. Score is accumulative. Maybe point revenue adjusts to
          // length of the solved passage.

        //lose, maybe watch an animation and receive a randomly-generated Shakespearean insult. Log top scores.
          // a global leaderboard would be cool.
    
    // coding considerations
    
        ///////Main content arrays should be inside of meta-arrays (or if necessary, objects) 
          ///////that classify (and eventually show on screen) the literature (and section) of 
          ///////the source of the generated puzzle.

             /////// What if I could pass arrays to this program, or even packages? Shakespeare, speeches, songs, 
             /////// web-dev and other technical definitions, the constitution, documents etc. anywho,

        //will need

            // a creative healthbar (maybe animation?) that fits the theme. 
            // A lot of testing to find sweet spot of penalty/health ratio and increment.
            // (knowledge of DOM scripting!)
            // (help with HTML page and graphics)
            // LOTS OF HELP!!!!!
            // at least 4 hrs/day

    // current coding progress:

        // declare all necessary arrays and other variables
        // make an array of the strSolution, per character
        // make an array of the user progress, per character
        // first run a loop that changes each user progress index to _ if a letter, or special character
          // call a function that prints the user progress
        
        //make a function that takes the user input
           // loop through the strSolution array, if the input character (lc) == matches the , set the
            // value of progress[x] to strSolution [x]
             // call a function that prints the user progress

        // array for letters guessed

// Who would Fardels bear,
// To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
// But that the dread of something after death,
// The undiscovered Country, from whose bourn
// No Traveller returns, Puzzles the will,
// And makes us rather bear those ills we have,
// Than fly to others that we know not of.
// Thus Conscience does make Cowards of us all,
// And thus the Native hue of Resolution
// Is sicklied o'er, with the pale cast of Thought,
// And enterprises of great pith and moment,
// With this regard their Currents turn awry,
// And lose the name of Action. Soft you now,
// The fair Ophelia? Nymph, in thy Orisons
// Be all my sins remembered.]
